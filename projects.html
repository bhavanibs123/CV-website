        <li>  <h3>VEHICLE ACCEDENT DETECTION USING GPS AND GSM</h3>  </li>
          <p>

           An automatic alarm device for vehicle accidents is introduced . When the accident occurs the alert message
  is sent automatically to the rescue team and to the police station. The message is sent through the GSM
  module and the location of the accident is detected with the help of the GPS module.

            <li><h3>AUTOMATED PLANT WATERING SYSTEM USING AURDINO</h3>    </li>

          <p>

            In this project, soil moisture sensor senses the moisture level of the soil. If soil will get dry then sensor
  senses low moisture level and automatically switches on the water pump to supply water to the plant. As
  plant get sufficient water and soil get wet then sensor senses enough moisture in soil.

            <li>  <h3>FACE RECOGNITION ATTENDACE SYSTEM USING PYTHON</h3></li>
            <p>
              Face recognition is one of the best and one of the regularly developing security features used. In our proje
ct the attendance in a class will be registered by a Camera. This is done using the OpenCV module. Using
OpenCV library it can be formulated and the matched student face is then compared to the stored
database.
